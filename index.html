          <p> Creating music can be difficult if you don't know music theory, all you need is perfect pitch and an understanding on
            where to put notes. My number one rule is to occasionally bend the "rules" of music theory. </p>

          <li> The basic C major scale is C-D-E-F-G-A-B, while not not the best at piano, I know those will always be on the white
            keys.</li>
          <li> C minor is C-D-(D#/Eb)-F-G-(G#/Ab)-(A#/Bb). It uses 3 black keys and # is a sharp note and b is a flat note.</li>
